# Project Registry

> Purpose: **Source of truth for project selection** to clarify "which project is the request for?"
> Request/requirements addition aligns consistency based on `Project ID` in this list.

## Rules (Minimum)

- When new project request (`project-request-template.md`) is approved, issue **Project ID (`PRJ-...`)** and register here. (Responsible: EO)
- New projects may not have Repo yet, so register as `TBD`, then update when Repo is confirmed.
- Requirements addition for existing projects (`requirements-request-template.md`) must match **Project ID + Repo**.
